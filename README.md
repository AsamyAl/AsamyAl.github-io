## What is YHBH ?

YHBH is short for "You Have Been Hacked". This is a silly Web-Page which presents the message that you have bene hacked. This page is just for fun, I used this page while recording some Videos for attacks such as DNS Poisoning attack.
You are free to make changes in the codes, and make it more cool. 
Submit a Pull Request and I'll definitelly merge it if your work is really cool.
However you can also share your YHBH pages.
